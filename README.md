# Keras_FLOP_Estimator
This is a function for estimating the floating point operations (FLOPS) of deep learning models developed with keras. It supports some basic layers such as Convolutional, Separable Convolution, Depthwise Convolution, BatchNormalization, Activations, and Merge Layers (Add, Max, Concatenate)
